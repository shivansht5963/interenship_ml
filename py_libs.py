KERAS

It provides many inbuilt methods for groping, combining and filtering data. Keras is a very popular Machine Learning library for Python. It is a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It can run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU. Keras makes it really for ML beginners to build and design a Neural Network. One of the best things about Keras is that it allows for easy and fast prototyping.
