classification of SL
It is classified into two type
-classification
-regression

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To find the connection between dependent and independent variables.

Dependent Variable: The outcome or value you want to predict (e.g., humidity).

Independent Variable: The factor used to make predictions (e.g., temperature).

Example:

If temperature is the independent variable and humidity is the dependent variable:

As temperature increases, humidity decreases.

This shows an inverse correlation.

Usage: Mostly used for forecasting and projections.

REGRESSION (SL)
Organizations commonly use regression models for stock prediction.

This involves analyzing past stock prices and trends to find patterns.

Popular regression algorithms in Supervised Learning (SL) include:

Linear Regression

Regression Trees

Non-Linear Regression

Bayesian Linear Regression

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BIAS
In the simplest terms, Bias is the difference between the Predicted Value and the Expected Value.

To explain further, the model makes certain assumptions when it trains on the data provided.

When it is introduced to the testing/validation data, these assumptions may not always be correct.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VARIANCE
Variance refers to the amount the target model will change when trained with different training data.

For a good model, the variance should be minimized.
